Laurent Jalabert was almost on home soil when he claimed there the 1995 edition of the Critérium International, although his compatriot Pascal Lance proved to be the fastest of a time-trial set in the Tarn city. In 2001, Lavaur welcomed the Tour for the first time. Belgian Rik Verbrughe, winner that year of the Flèche Wallonne as well as the prologue of the Giro, victoriously crossed the line ahead of his breakaway companions. Ten years later, there wasn’t much anyone could do against Mark Cavendish, capturing his 18th sprint success on the Tour.
